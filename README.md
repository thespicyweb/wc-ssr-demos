# Demos of Enhance, Lit, and WebC Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Node

Just `npm i` and then run:

* `npm run enhance-ssr` for the Enhance demo
* `npm run lit-ssr` for the Lit demo
* `npm run webc-ssr` for the WebC demo

All are available at `http://localhost:3000`. Feel free to play around with the elements in each `*-ssr` folder and reload the page!

For context on what this is all about, read The Spicy Web article (coming soon).
